- 📌 **Consistent Underutilization:** Office equipment budgets were consistently underutilized, suggesting either over-budgeting or procurement inefficiencies.
- 📌 **Negative Variances:** Some categories recorded negative variance, flagging overspending that may require justification or review.
- 📌 **Dynamic Year Filtering:** Dashboard allows filtering between 2024, 2025, or both — enabling quick comparisons and trend spotting.

## 📌 Conclusion & Recommendations

### ✅ Conclusion
This expenditure analysis provided valuable clarity on how LADMA allocates and utilizes its annual budget across key operational categories. By comparing actual spend against allocated budgets and identifying variances, the dashboard uncovers both underutilized and overspent areas. This transparency can support more informed decision-making, promote financial accountability, and help streamline future budget planning. Ultimately, the insights revealed serve as a foundation for fostering more efficient resource management and improving overall fiscal discipline within the institution.

### 💡 Recommendations
- Introduce quarterly expenditure reviews to catch overspending early.

- Review procurement policies, especially for underutilized budget lines like office equipment.

- Introduce approval workflows to justify excess spending in certain categories.
